# Development

## Starting the app with docker for dev purposes

The dev environment uses dev version of docker compose and Dockerfile.
_Hot Reloading is enabled, bind mounting is enabled from app folder of host to app folder of container._

Note that if you change a file the host machine will be affected with the new version, likewise if you change
something into the host machine, the local machine will be affected.

From the main folder:

```
make build-dev
```

Start the app with:

```
make run-dev
```
